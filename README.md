Hello! I'm Anthony. Software Engineer @ Google and sometimes creator of personal projects.

Most of my obsessions as of late have been messing around with Windows and Linux.

Here's a list of some projects on my profile:
* College Asignments
* C programs
* Unity (C#) Game Projects
* Python Projects (Web Servers, Minecraft server wrapper, etc.)
* Guides e.g.: [NR2003 on Linux](https://github.com/anthonymendez/NR2003-on-Linux)
* Minecraft Mods in Java
